# Lattice Boltzmann Implementation on GPU

A simple implementation of the 2D Lattice Boltzmann Method in C, accompanied by a CUDA version to run on a GPU. Geometry is a spherical boundary, generating Karman vortices. Perdiodic boundary conditions.

This project was implememented in Summer 2023 during the ENGAGE Summer School on HPC & Data-Science.
